## Lessons over Data structure

#### Array

    - Array is one kind of list
    - Adding and removing elements from array is harder comparing with linked list

#### Linked List
    - single and double
    - next and next + previous

#### Stack
    - add means push
    - remove means pop
    - lifo = last in first out

#### Queue
    - Line of bills
    - fifo = first in first out
    - first = head, last = tail
    - add = enqueue, remove = dequeue, peek = the head element

#### Sort
